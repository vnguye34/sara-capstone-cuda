### Check-in Part II

Problem Statement:

Using Neural Networks, is it possible to classify classical music by composition era? In this projct, I will prove that by processing classical music audio files in the .m4a format, it is possible to extract meaningful "snapshots" of the audio wave form that can be classified by a pattern recognition CNN for composition period.

Objective: determine whether or not 20 second "image" snippets of classical music files belong to one of the six canonical periods for classical music: medieval, renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic and 20th / 21st century.
